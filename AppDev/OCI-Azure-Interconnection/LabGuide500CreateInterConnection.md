# Building Multi-Cloud Apps

## Create Cross-Cloud Interconnect


#### **Introduction**

Oracle and Microsoft have built a dedicated, high-throughput, low-latency, private network connection between Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure data centers in the Ashburn, London and Toronto region that provides a data conduit between the two clouds. You can use the connection to securely transfer data at a high enough rate for offline handoffs and to support the performance required for primary applications that span the two clouds. You can access the connection by using either Oracle FastConnect or Microsoft ExpressRoute, as shown below, and you don’t need to deal with configuration details or third-party carriers.

FastConnect and ExpressRoute together create a path for workloads on both clouds to communicate directly and efficiently, which gives you flexibility on how to develop and deploy services and solutions across Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Microsoft Azure.

You will experience the following benefits when you interconnect the Oracle and Microsoft clouds:

- Secure private connection between the two clouds. No exposure to the internet.
- High availability and reliability. Built-in redundant 10-Gbps physical connections between the clouds.
- High performance, low latency, predictable performance compared to the internet or routing through an on-premises network.
- Straightforward, one-time setup.
- No intermediate service provider required to enable the connection.

Let's get started in order to connect developed and deployed application on Azure VM with Autonomous Database on Oracle Cloud.

## Steps

### Task 1: Setup Azure ExpressRoute

- On the upper-left side of the Azure home screen, select **Create a resource** and type in the search bar **ExpressRoute** and click **Create.** 

![](./images/500/ExpressRouteCreate1.PNG)

- Add in the required details the following:

  - Provide **Circuit Name**, such as **Azure_OCI_ExpressRoute**.

  - Select **Provider**, such as **Oracle Cloud FastConnect**.

  - Select **Peering Location**, it is **London** in this example.

  - Choose the **Bandwidth**, it is enough **50Mbps** for testing purposes.

  - Leave **SKU** as **Standard**.

  - Change **Billing model** to **Metered**.

  - Choose your **Subscription**.

  - Select the **Resource group** you created before: **OCI_Interconnection**.

  - Select **Location** as **UK South**.

  - Click **Create**.

![](./images/500/FastConnectCreate2.PNG)

- On the **Create Connection** screen provide the following:

  - Select **Use Oracle Provider**.

  - Select **Microsoft Azure: ExpressRoute** as a **Provider**.

  - Click **Next**.

![](./images/500/FastConnectCreate3.PNG)

- Under **Configuration** tab, please provide the following:

  - Provide **Name**, such as **OCI_Azure_FastConnect**.
  - Select your **Compartment**.
  - Select **Virtual Circuit Type** as **Private Virtual Circuit**.
  - Choose **Dynamic Routing Gateway** you created before.
  - Choose **Provisioned Bandwidth** for testing purposes as **1 Gbps**.
  - Provide **Provider Service Key**, you noted down in the previous step.

![](./images/500/FastConnectCreate4.PNG)

  - The connection between Azure VNet and OCI VCN uses BGP dynamic routing. Scroll down and provide the **BGP IP addresses** that will be used for the two redundant BGP sessions between Oracle and Azure:
    - A primary pair of BGP addresses:
      - **Customer Primary BGP IP Address**: **10.0.0.22/30**.
      - **Oracle Primary BGP IP Address**: **10.0.0.21/30.**
    - A separate, secondary pair of BGP addresses:
      - **Customer Secondary BGP IP Address**: **10.0.0.26/30**.
      - **Oracle Secondary BGP IP Address:** **10.0.0.25/30**.

You provide /30 addresses here for the BGP connection. The second and third in each /30 are used as BGP IP address pair. The second address in the block is for the Oracle side of the BGP session and the third address in the block is for the Azure side of the BGP session.

- Click **Create**
